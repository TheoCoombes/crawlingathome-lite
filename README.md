# crawlingathome-lite
A lightweight version of the Crawling@Home worker script, suitable for single-cored instances with 2GB of ram.

### With thanks to [@christophschuhmann](https://github.com/christophschuhmann) for developing the worker code, as well as the core script.
NOTE: The core script is not currently provided here, as it contains Google Drive API keys.
